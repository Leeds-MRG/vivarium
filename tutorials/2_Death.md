Tutorial Two: Death
===================

In this tutorial we're going to make something happen to the simulants we created last time. We're going to make them die. We'll define a mortality rate and setup a new event listener than uses that rate to decide which simulants die during each time step.

Dynamic Values
--------------
The next important `CEAM` concept we'll use is the dynamically calculated values. Simulations are composed of many components which interact but may change from experiment to experiment so it's important that they be designed in such a way that they don't assume the presence of other components that are not absolutely necessary. Here's a concrete example. Say you're writing a simulation that models the effect of smoking on mortality. It's relatively simple to come up with a formula for that and include it in your mortality calculation. But what happens if in a future experiment you want to model BMI instead? Or both? To make those changes you'll need to modify the mortality calculation directly. `CEAM`'s dynamically calculated values give us a way to model mortality (and similar values) in such a way that models for things that effect mortality, like smoking and BMI, can be plugged in or unplugged transparently.

Dynamic values in `CEAM` have globally unique names. So, the value for mortality rate might be named 'mortality_rate' and any code that refers to that name is assumed to be referring to the same value. Keep that in mind when naming values. If you have an incidence rate, calling it 'incidence_rate' is likely to cause confusion since other components will have their own incidence rates. Better to use a more specific form like 'incidence_rate.heart_disease'. Each named value has three important parts. The first is it's source which is a function that can calculate the base form of that value. For example the 'mortality_rate' value would need a source function that could calculate cause deleted mortality rates for each simulant. The second part are the values mutators. These are any function that will change the value from it's base form. An example would be a model of smoking that increases the mortality rate for simulants who are smokers. Components can add new mutators to a value when they are added to the simulation. The third part is the value consumers. These are any functions that use the final value after any mutators have been applied to the base form. An example of a consumer is the code that uses the mortality rate to decide which simulants die. We'll create a named value with a source and a consumer in this tutorial. The next tutorial will add a mutator.
