===============================

**No GBD information here**

Simulations frequently rely on external sources of data.

lookup tables provide values where needed  in the sim

lookup table has the interface

This data can vary along dimensions (make sure there isn't a limit there)

interpolation gives more accurate values, lookup tables hold on to these
