Starting Out
------------

Here we'll produce a data-free disease model focusing on core ``vivarium``
concepts. More complicated versions of the components built here can be found
in the ``vivarium_public_health``(www.github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_public_health) library.

Those components must additionally deal with manipulating complex data which makes understanding
what's going on more complicated. After this tutorial, you should be well poised to begin working with
and examining those components.
